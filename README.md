# WebAssembly Types
Typescript declaration for WebAssembly JS API

NOTE: Node.js v8.0.0 is the first version that will
support WebAssembly MVP. Since it's not yet released
we assume its been downloaded or compiled locally
and the executable is ../node/node. According to
[this](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12220#issuecomment-294511442)
v8.0.0 should be released by end on May 30th 2017.

I tested by compiling [node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
from sources on master branch at sha1
[c68da89694b1ff4682131ed6b825e596188cc4ed](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/c68da89694b1ff4682131ed6b825e596188cc4ed)
